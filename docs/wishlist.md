| 1   | Error Handling       | The main errors are either file based or parsing based. File errors break the application because if the `data/*.data` file isn't found or if the `./data/*.log` files aren't found then the application wouldn't be able to run. In the case of parsing I log + count the errors but I do not blow up the application. I would have preferred to use an `Either()` monad here to make the code easier to read and handle exceptions in a much cleaner fashion that would also make it easier to test.                                                                   |
| 2   | Dependency Injection | If I had more time I would have liked to have added dependency injection so tests would have been easier to write. Currently the `fs` and `readline` packages make it difficult to write many of the tests. The way that I would have approached it would have to used a `Reader()` monad to pass all the dependancies to each relevant function                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| 3   | Tests                | I skimped on the tests as I didn't feel it was as important for this test and the speed at which I put this together. If it were to be a real production application I would have put it together using the dependency injection methods I mentioned above to fill out the tests. Secondarily many of the functions are either writing to a file or simple message output and doesn't make sense to put too much effort into those. Unit test code coverage is very important to me and this would be the first thing that I would tackle to make this program complete. |
| 4   | Functional           | Converting most of these functions to a functional paradigm would have made the code more testable but also more approachable and allowed me to write each function to be "pure". Meaning I wouldn't modify state and there would be no side effects.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 5   | Compilation          | I would have liked to compile the entire package to a single file.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

I would keep an array in memory to do so</li><li>Generate far more mock data</li><li>Write it in <code>TypeScript</code> and stored here <code>src/utils/script.mocks.ts</code>.

I wanted to speak to some things that I would have done to round out this application given it needed to be production ready.
