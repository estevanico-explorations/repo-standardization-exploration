# Why?
I am trying to set forth my philosophies on repository architecture for different types of repos

## What do?
This is a ***WORKING*** library. It may not work perfectly as this is an exploration but the concepts I'm looking to explore will *work*.

## Repo Types or something I guess?
I can't think of any other types so I have what I am thinking of here

- API
  - client component (e.g. React)
  - style component/library (e.g. scss)
  - utility library
  - server library
  - framework
- App
  - web
  - server
  - commandline script / utility
- Serverless
  - I dunno where i'd put this I guess
- Configuration
  - eslint, prettier, etc
